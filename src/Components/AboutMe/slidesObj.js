                I spent 5 years in a fast paced, metric driven environment with
                most of that time dedicated to training new and current
                employees until I started leading a project to updrade some of
                our more sophisticated analyzers. While working on this project
                I found a passion for code and now want to build applications
                with great UI.

                I recently completed an immersive software engineering program
                and am now seeking a position as a full stack developer. I spend
                my free time working on side projects to continue my learning
                and growth and have built a reddit clone in order to gain
                familiarity with <b>Next.js, Recoil, and Firebase</b>. I am now
                focusing on a 3rd party plugin for a note taking tool,
                collaborating with a UI/UX designer to make metadata more
                accessible to new users.

                My passion is for creating applications with user experiences
                that don't frustrate users. One of the big pushes for me to
                change careers was a constant thought of "How hard can it be to
                make this app better to interact with?" I hope to find a job
                where I can be a part of a team making peoples lives easier
                while building software that is easy and intuitive to use.
