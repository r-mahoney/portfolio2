        years after college in a fast paced, metric driven environment
        using a lot of applications with poorly designed
        UIs. I spent most of my time training new and
        current employees until I started leading a
        project to updrade some of our more
        sophisticated analyzers. During that time, I found a
        passion for debugging and writing code which led
        me to pursue a full time career in development.</>,

        per week learning some popular technologies,
        when I am not applying for full time engineering
        positions, I am spending my time working on
        projects to keep my skills sharp. I just
        completed a project building a reddit clone in
        order to gain familiarity with <b>Next.js, Recoil,
        and Firebase</b>. I am now focusing on a 3rd party
        plugin for a note taking tool, collaborating
        with a UI/UX designer to make metadata more
        accessible to new users.</>,
